//14. Write a C# program to convert meters to feet or inches. There are 39.37 inches in one
//meter and 12 inches in a foot.If the length is less than 1 foot, just report the number of
//inches. Show two digits after the decimal point. Thus 3.4 meters converts to 11.15 feet,
//and .2 meter converts to 7.87 inches.
